Hello! This is the README


Hi! I finally was able to find this one here !
Just want to be sure we can do this !!!!
Git Workflow
- checkout to a new feature branch
- write some code
- git add, git commit, several times
- once the feature is complete, push up  code
- open a PR
- partner reviews code, merges
- everyone on the team: checkout to main, pull down changes, then open a new branch
- repeat
